# gpa_calc
I wrote this to calculate and keep track of my college gpa
I use the text file gpa_scale.txt to keep track of the weights of each letter grade.
The program reads this data in and creates a map storing the letter with its value.
The program then reads in a passed text file containing the credit hour and the letter grade of classes 
for example:
  4 A
  3 B+
  4 A-
The program reads this data in and then computes the gpa.
